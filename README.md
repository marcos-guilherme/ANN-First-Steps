# Content

The content is a "Hello World" to understand a little more about artificial neural networks, with the recognition of handwritten digits.

# Purpose

I want to make it clear that this code was collected from a book [(link)](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html) by **Michael Nielsen**, and used by me in order to learn more about the content of artificial neural networks.

## Testing

I will do some tests to observe how the network behaves by varying some parameters and I will add them here in the future.
